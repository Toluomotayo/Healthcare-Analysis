# 🏥 Healthcare Analysis Dashboard

This project is a comprehensive Power BI dashboard designed to uncover insights from healthcare data, focusing on patient demographics, hospital operations, financial trends, and clinical outcomes. The dataset was sourced from **Onyx Data's Monthly Challenge**.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal was to turn raw hospital data into actionable insights for **non-technical stakeholders**, such as healthcare executives and operations managers. The dashboard supports smarter decisions in **patient care planning, treatment efficiency, and financial strategy**.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Excel** – for initial exploration and data formatting  
- **Power Query** – for data cleaning and transformation  
- **Power BI** – for dashboard creation and interactive visuals  
- **DAX** – for calculated metrics and KPIs  
- **Custom Calendar Table** – to enable time-based analysis

## 📌 Dashboard Highlights

### 🔹 Page 1: Patient Demographics
- KPIs: Total Patients, Gender Split, Blood Type Frequency, Age Distribution  
- **Insight**: Most patients were aged **50–59**, with **A+** as the most common blood type

### 🔹 Page 2: Hospitalization & Treatment Outcomes
- KPIs: Avg. Length of Stay, Test Result Distribution, Admission Types  
- **Insight**: **55%** of patients had abnormal results; stay duration remained steady from 2019–2024

### 🔹 Page 3: Financial & Insurance Overview
- KPIs: Total Billing, Avg. Billing per Patient, Billing by Condition & Provider  
- **Insight**: **Hypertension and diabetes** led in billing; **Medicare** accounted for the highest spend

## ⚙️ Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Creating dynamic KPIs across time periods | Built a **calendar table** and used **DAX** time intelligence functions |
| Cleaning inconsistent or missing data | Used **Power Query** to transform and structure raw datasets |
| Filtering by multiple user-friendly dimensions (e.g., age, condition, blood type) | Implemented slicers and dropdowns for flexible, intuitive navigation |
| Ensuring performance with large data volume | Optimized model by minimizing unnecessary columns and using star schema principles |

## ✅ Recommendations

- Launch targeted wellness programs for patients aged 50–59  
- Improve diagnostics to reduce **abnormal and inconclusive** test results  
- Optimize resource planning using trends in **admission types and room usage**  
- Review cost structures for **chronic conditions** and negotiate better terms with insurers
